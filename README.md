# LSTM Jazz Generator üé∑

This project implements a music generation model using an LSTM network to perform **jazz improvisation**. Inspired by DeepLearning.AI's Deep Learning Specialization (Course 5: Sequence Models), the model learns patterns from jazz melodies and generates new sequences that resemble human-like improvisation.

## üéº Project Overview

The model takes a sequence of musical notes and learns to generate the next note in the sequence, simulating the improvisation process used in jazz.

Key features:
- Sequence modeling using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
- Training on MIDI/audio-derived note sequences
- Output is a playable jazz-style melody in `.wav` format

## üìÅ Required Files

This project relies on a sample training audio file that could not be uploaded directly due to file size limits:

- **Download** `training_example.wav` and place it in the `data/` folder
